
<b>Project Cluster</b>

The motivation behind this project is practice. One of my current professional goals is to become a good data scientist. I understand this takes time, but more importantly this takes practice. I want to practice the many aspects of being a data scientist. This includes setting up a data and compute environment. This will be the first phase of this project. To achieve this, I have been collecting old hardware from family, friends and craigslist.
